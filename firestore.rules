/**
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset establishes a security model for an e-commerce
 * application. It makes the product catalog publicly readable by anyone but
 * ensures that user-specific data, like shopping carts, is strictly private.
 *
 * Data Structure: The data is organized into two main collections. A top-level
 * `/products` collection holds the public catalog. User-specific data is
 * nested under `/users/{userId}`, with a `shopping_cart` subcollection to
 * ensure each user can only access their own items.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Public Product Catalog: The `/products` collection is world-readable to
 *   allow browsing by both anonymous and authenticated users.
 * - Restricted Product Writes: To maintain catalog integrity, all write
 *   operations (`create`, `update`, `delete`) on the `/products` collection
 *   are disabled by default in these rules. Securely enabling this would
 *   require adding an `ownerId` or `adminId` field to the Product entity
 *   and implementing appropriate admin-only or owner-only write rules.
 * - Private Shopping Carts: A user's shopping cart is stored in a subcollection
 *   (`/users/{userId}/shopping_cart`). This path-based ownership model is
 *   highly secure and performant, guaranteeing that only the authenticated
 *   owner can view or modify their cart contents.
 * - No User Listing: The rules do not allow for querying the top-level
 *   `/users` collection, protecting user privacy.
